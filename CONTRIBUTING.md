# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this guide! Here are some guidelines:

## Correcting spelling mistakes or other editorial changes

For corrections to ~~speeling~~ spelling mistakes or other editorial changes that don't change the underlying suggestion, feel free to create a pull request to this repo without discussion. There is a check on all PRs that ensures that documents have been formatted correctly; to run this locally, you can do

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# format documents
$ npm run format
```

## Requesting changes or updates to suggestions

If you would like to request a change or update to a suggestion, please either:

1. Start a discussion or open an issue and bring at least one reference, or
2. Open a PR with the change and with references cited

Note that in both cases, at least one reference is requested. For the sake of this guide, a reference could be (but is not limited to):

- A link to official bundler documentation (perhaps informing why a setting is recommended)
- A GitHub comment by a person working on a JS runtime (maybe saying why they need something a specific way)
